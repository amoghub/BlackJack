# BlackJack

BlackJack is an iOS card game that is designed to simulate the real life version of the casino game "BlackJack", also known as "21". The objective of BlackJack is to get as close to 21 (using the numbers on the cards) as you can, without going over 21. All face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) have a value of 10, and the Ace card can either be used as a 1 or an 11, dependant on the player. 

## Code and Design

The player will go against the dealer, which has been desgined to know what the player has and when to start or stop dealing cards. The player is greeted with two cards to their hand, and two cards to the dealer. By pressing deal, the player is able to receive a card if they feel they are able to get closer to 21. The player has a total of 5 cards, and is able to see the total of these cards in the "Current Hand" label. Once the player is ready, they can hit the "Stand!" button to see who is the closest to 21.
